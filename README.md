# "Breezy" is a Ecommerce based website.
## This is based on selling 'Polaroids' as a product but one can change it according to their own preference, e.g Apparel(Clothes), Shoes etc.

This project was developed using Angular framework. As this is only a front end work, I've not included API endpoints but will do it later on.

There are some minor things left to do but will be added soon.
