"Breezy" is an Ecommerce based website.
This is based on selling 'Polaroids' as a product but one can change it according to their own preference, e.g Apparel (Clothes), Shoes etc.

This project was developed using Angular framework.

There are some minor things left to do but will be added soon.

If not then run this command
```
npm install -g @angular/cli

Run the development server:
